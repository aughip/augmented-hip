### Method 2

You can also install it into the direct drivers folder.

Access the SteamVR folder

![opening steamvr local files](https://raytracing-benchmarks.are-really.cool/Af6eSnS.png)

Go to the `drivers` folder and create a new folder with whatever name you want. Maybe `augmented-hip`

Copy the files and folders from the zip file in [Releases](https://github.com/hyblocker/augmented-hip/releases/tag/0.1):
```
bin
resources
driver.vrdrivermanifest
```
into that newly created folder.

# Troubleshooting

## My hip flips when I slightly turn around!

Ensure that the tracker on your left foot is using the "Left Foot" tracker role, and, also, that the tracker on your right foot is using using the "Right Foot" tracker role.

If you can find the menu to do so by opening SteamVR settings and going to the **Manage Vive Trackers** section under the **Controllers** tab.

You can figure out which tracker is which by clicking the "Identify" button.
